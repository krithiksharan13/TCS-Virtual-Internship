# TCS Data Visualization Virtual Internship-Forge

This repository contains the solutions to the tasks that were completed as a part of the TATA Data Visualization Virtual Internship Program. The program was hosted on Forage and the solutions provided here are intended to serve as a reference for anyone looking to learn data visualization or PowerBI.

# **TASK-1**

To prepare for your meeting, you need to draft questions that you think will be important and relevant to the CEO and CMO. This preparation will be your guide as you develop your presentation. For this task, you are only required to draft the questions. Make sure to think both quantitatively and qualitatively. You’ve been provided a dataset in the resources below to use as the basis for your exploration. Review this data, taking note of what information has been provided, what insights you can garner, and what is relevant to both the CEO and CMO respectively. Create a set of four questions that you anticipate each business leader will ask and want to know the answers to. Make sure you differentiate your questions, as both the CEO and CMO view business decisions through different lenses. Submit your eight questions in total (4 for the CEO and 4 for the CMO) in the text submission box below.

## **Four questions for the CEO:**

1. Can you provide a revenue trend analysis to determine whether retail sales are seasonal?
2. Which countries have the most potential for growth and what steps can be taken to further seize those markets?
3. Who are the top consumers making the most purchases from the business, and what is their contribution to the company's overall revenue?
4. Which regions are producing the greatest revenue and what strategies can be implemented to expand sales in untapped markets?

## **Four questions for the CMO:**

1. What marketing strategies have been most effective in driving sales and increasing revenue?
2. How has customer demographic data influenced the business's marketing decisions, and what insights can be gleaned from that data to further optimize marketing efforts?
3. Are there any notable differences in purchasing behavior across different customer segments, and how can marketing efforts be tailored to those differences?
4. What metrics are being used to measure the effectiveness of marketing campaigns, and how can those metrics be improved to better inform marketing decisions?

## **Visualization of data in PowerBI for each question for the CEO:**

**Question 1**

The CEO of the retail store is interested to view the time series of the revenue data for the year 2011 only. He would like to view granular data by looking into revenue for each month. The CEO is interested in viewing the seasonal trends and wants to dig deeper into why these trends occur. This analysis will be helpful for the CEO to forecast for the next year.



**Question 2**

The CMO is interested in viewing the top 10 countries which are generating the highest revenue. Additionally, the CMO is also interested in viewing the quantity sold along with the revenue generated. The CMO does not want to have the United Kingdom in this visual.



**Question 3**

The CMO of the online retail store wants to view the information on the top 10 customers by revenue. He is interested in a visual that shows the greatest revenue generating customer at the start and gradually declines to the lower revenue generating customers. The CMO wants to target the higher revenue generating customers and ensure that they remain satisfied with their products.


**Question 4**

The CEO is looking to gain insights on the demand for their products. He wants to look at all countries and see which regions have the greatest demand for their products. Once the CEO gets an idea of the regions that have high demand, he will initiate an expansion strategy which will allow the company to target these areas and generate more business from these regions. He wants to view the entire data on a single view without the need to scroll or hover over the data points to identify the demand. There is no need to show data for the United Kingdom as the CEO is more interested in viewing the countries that have expansion opportunities.



# **TASK-4**

Develop a script and record a video presenting your findings to the CEO and CMO based on the four questions they asked and the visuals you created in the previous tasks.

You can use your work or the model answer from the previous task to develop your presentation.

When writing your script, you should speak about your entire process, including the initial data load and clean-up steps so that your leaders know you’ve done your due diligence in providing error-free analysis. Data analysis provides heaps of information but remember to focus on the information that is most important to your leaders.

Your video should be approximately 5 minutes in length. You can record your video in the browser or upload a video from your device below.

Remember, this is not just a read out of your visuals, you’re presenting to the CEO and CMO and need to provide context for each scenario and how it relates to their questioning.

You do not need to submit your script or talking points for this deliverable.

## **Script:**

Good Afternoon,
I'm Krithik Sharan, and I'm excited to share insights regarding your company. I appreciate you providing the guiding questions—understanding the type of analysis you’re looking for has been extremely helpful. I truly believe the findings will be valuable as you plan your next business moves.

1st
For your first query, the CEO is looking at revenue trends to determine if retail sales exhibit seasonality. Based on the data, there are specific months with significant growth. Sales from January to August remained stable, averaging $685K per month. However, in September, revenue surged by 40% compared to August. This upward trend continued through November, reaching $1.5 million, the highest of the year. Since December data is incomplete, no conclusions can be drawn for that month. This analysis highlights that retail sales experience seasonality, with notable growth occurring in the last four months of the year.

2nd
The second graph presents the top 10 countries with the most potential for growth. Since the UK already has strong demand and the focus is on markets with expansion opportunities, it is excluded from this dataset. The analysis shows that the Netherlands, Ireland, Germany, and France have high unit sales and revenue. To capitalize on these opportunities, I recommend directing efforts toward strengthening market presence in these regions.

3rd
The third analysis examines the top 10 consumers who have made the highest purchases. The data reveals that differences among these top buyers are minimal. The highest-spending customer only spent 17% more than the second highest, indicating that the company’s revenue is not overly dependent on a small number of consumers. This suggests a healthy business structure with limited buyer negotiating power.

4th
The final analysis, represented in a map chart, compares revenue generation across different regions. Excluding the UK, countries like the Netherlands, Ireland, Germany, France, and Australia generate substantial profits, suggesting they are strong investment opportunities. The map also indicates that most sales are concentrated in Europe, with minimal presence in the Americas and no significant market in Africa, Asia, or Russia. A new strategy targeting these underrepresented regions could enhance sales revenue and overall profitability.

I sincerely appreciate your time. Once you've reviewed this information, please let me know if you have any questions or if you'd like any additional analyses. I'd be happy to assist further.
Thank You
